Description: Provides pipeline audit trails and data diagnostics for
    tidyverse workflows. The audit trail system captures lightweight
    metadata snapshots at each step of a pipeline, building a structured audit
    report without storing the data itself. Also includes tidyverse ports
    of diagnostic functions from 'dtaudit'.
